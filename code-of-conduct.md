# Code of Conduct

## 1. Purpose

A primary goal of QueerAus is to be inclusive to the largest number of members, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof).

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

We invite all those who participate in QueerAus to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.

## 2. Fediverse Citizenship

A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase fediverse "citizenship" by encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the relationships between our actions and their effects on our community.

Communities mirror the societies in which they exist and positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that exist in society.

If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our community is welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute to the fullest extent, we want to know.

## 3. Expected Behavior

The following behaviors are expected and requested of all community members:

- All content on this server must be compliant with Australian law. This server is hosted in Australia, and so moderators have the discretion to remove content as required by law.
- Discrimination and bigotry won't be tolerated. This is designed to be a safe space for LGBTQIA+ people, so we have zero tolerance for Nazism, TERFs, or hate speech.
- Respect other users. Please be nice to people who are new to the Fediverse and Mastodon, including our new Twitter refugees.
- Use Content Warnings for NSFW content. While NSFW content is allowed, please do not post it without a CW tag or it will be removed. If it's illegal or discriminatory, see Rule 1 & 2.
- Listen; Don’t Make Excuses. If you’re accused of causing harm, either take some responsibility or ask moderators for help.

## 4. Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are considered harassment and are unacceptable within our community:

 * Violence, threats of violence or violent language directed against another person.
 * Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.
 * Posting or displaying sexually explicit or violent material.
 * Posting or threatening to post other people's personally identifying information ("doxing").
 * Personal insults, particularly those related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, or disability.
 * Inappropriate photography or recording.
 * Inappropriate physical contact. You should have someone's consent before touching them.
 * Unwelcome sexual attention. This includes, sexualized comments or jokes; inappropriate touching, groping, and unwelcomed sexual advances.
 * Deliberate intimidation, stalking or following (online or in person).
 * Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
 * Sustained disruption of community events, including talks and presentations.

## 5. Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the community organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning.

## 7. Reporting Guidelines

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify moderation staff as soon as possible:
- Email contact@aus.lgbt
- DM/Toot at @staff@aus.lgbt


Additionally, moderation staff are available to help community members engage with local law enforcement or to otherwise help those experiencing unacceptable behavior feel safe. In the context of in-person events, moderation staff will also provide escorts as desired by the person experiencing distress.

## 8. Addressing Grievances

If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should notify the QueerAus Moderation Team with a concise description of your grievance. Your grievance will be handled in accordance with our existing governing policies. 



## 9. Scope

We expect all community participants (contributors, paid or otherwise; sponsors; and other guests) to abide by this Code of Conduct in all community venues--online and in-person--as well as in all one-on-one communications pertaining to community business.

This code of conduct and its related procedures also applies to unacceptable behavior occurring outside the scope of community activities when such behavior has the potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being of community members.
