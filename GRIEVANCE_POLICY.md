# QueerAus Grievance Policy
## 1. Scope
The QueerAus Grievance Policy applies to:
- All interactions between members of the QueerAus Moderation team and non-moderating members of the server
- All interactions within the QueerAus Moderation Team
- All interactions between the QueerAus Moderation Team and staff of other servers

This policy does NOT apply to interactions between QueerAus members and anyone other than moderating staff on the QueerAus server. Refer to the MODERATION POLICY for these interactions.

## 2. Definitions
- Appeal: Where an individual wishes to dispute or challenge a decision that has been made by the QueerAus Moderation team in relation to a grievance that has been raised through the formal procedure outlined in this policy.
- Complaint: An objection or criticism that is raised about any incident relating to the QueerAus Moderation team. A complaint may not need to be responded to by way of formal resolution but should always be acknowledged.
- Complainant: A person who makes a complaint or raises a grievance who has experienced, and been affected by, a grievance-worthyÂ event.

- Grievance: Any complaint, concern, dispute or problem to do with QueerAus, its activities and events and the behaviour of volunteers when performing their duties can be a grievance. Grievances can arise due to the QueerAus Moderation team's behaviours, acts, situations, omissions, or decisions, which complainant considers to be unfair or unjustified and requires addressing by the QueerAus Moderation team and is raised in accordance with this policy and procedure.
- Moderation Team: Any user on the QueerAus server acting from the [@staff@aus.lgbt](https://aus.lgbt/@staff) account, or from any other account which has "Moderation Privileges"[^1].

### 2.1 "Submission of the Complaint"
The term "Submission of the Complaint" refers to the time at which the complaint is RECIEVED by the inbox of the QueerAus Moderation Team's mail server. Upon the first interaction with the Complainant, the Grievance Officer will communicate to them, via screenshot or other means, the date and time to be considered "Submission of the Complaint".

## 3. Procedure
The following procedural steps are a guideline of the actions which can be taken once a grievance has been identified.
Steps may be omitted at the discretion of the Grievance Officer, or upon request from the Complainant, if it becomes apparent that such an action would be inappropriate.

The complainant should submit, via email, a complaint to grievances@aus.lgbt, with the following information:
- Username of the Complainant AND the user(s) being reported
- Explanation of the grievance or complaint
- The actions taken by the moderation team (e.g. bans, mutes, reports) against the Complainant.
- Their preferred resolution to the incident
- Any evidence (screenshots, DMs, etc.) relevant to the Complaint

Once the grievance has been raised, the Grievance Officer will determine how the complaint should be handled. This may include contacting the staff involved in the incident. The Grievance Officer will determine whether the Complainant's preferred resolution is appropriate for the incident, and if not, they will attempt to mediate an alternative.

Upon reaching a conclusion, the Grievance Officer will communicate to the Complainant, including the conclusion, actions taken, and any relevant justifications.
### 3.1 Discretionary Rights
The Grievance Officer reserves the right to contact Law Enforcement, mental health professionals, or anyone else they deem relevant, in order to complete the grievance process. At all times, any documents, messages, Toots, or other communications deemed relevant to the grievance may be communicated to Law Enforcement at the sole discretion of the Grievance Officer.
### 3.2 Period Limitations
If the complaint is not resolved to the satisfaction of the Complainant within 14 days (unless extended by the Grievance Officer), the Grievance Officer has the right to independently resolve the incident through their own discretion.

Complaints may not be submitted for incidents which occurred greater than 24 months before the submission of the complaint.

## 4. Appeals
IF the QueerAus Moderation Team is composed of less than 5 people at the time of the submission of the complaint, there will be no appeal process available for the complaint.
IF the QueerAus Moderation Team is composed of 5 or more people at the time of the submission of the complaint, AND the grievance was resolved EITHER by implementing the Complainant's Preferred Resolution OR by an alternative resolution accepted by the complainant, there will be no appeal process available for the complaint.
IF the QueerAus Moderation Team is composed of 5 or more people at the time of the submission of the complaint, AND EITHER the grievance was resolved under Section 3.1 of the Policy OR the complaint was not resolved:
- The Complainant must submit a request for Appeal to appeals@aus.lgbt by email within 168 Hours (1 week) of the last communication from the Grievance Officer.
- A panel of 3 members of the moderation team, none of which may be those involved in the complaint or the Grievance Officer, will review the initial complaint, any relevant communications, and the conclusion reached by the Grievance Officer.
- The panel will then vote on whether the Grievance Officer's actions were sufficient:
  - If 2 or more panel members believe that the Grievance Officer's conclusion and resolution was adequate, no further actions will be taken, and no further appeal will be available for the complaint.
  - If 2 or more panel members believe that the Grievance Officer's conclusion and/or resolution was NOT adequate, a member of the moderation team will be assigned to follow the process of Section 3, with the "Submission of the Complaint" being taken as the communication of their decision to the Complainant from the panel.
The results of any appeal decision will be communicated to the Complainant by either a member of the panel, or by email from appeals@aus.lgbt.

They are formatted as "@user@server.tld has joined the Moderation team of QueerAus". These privileges are revoked in the same manner, with the message instead stating that ""@user@server.tld has left the Moderation team of QueerAus".
